# Gitty - Git Policy CLI

A Git workflow enforcement tool built with Cobra that helps teams maintain consistent branching strategies and avoid common Git mistakes.

## 🎯 Purpose

This CLI tool enforces Git flow-like policies to prevent common team workflow issues:
- **Forgetting to pull** before starting work
- **Forgetting to rebase** with the latest changes
- **Direct commits to protected branches** (main, uat, develop)
- **Inconsistent branch naming**
- **Merge conflicts** due to outdated branches

## 🏗️ Branch Strategy

```
main (production) ← hotfix branches
├── uat (customer testing)
└── develop (team development) ← feature branches
    └── feature/* (new features)
    └── hotfix/* (production fixes)
```

## 🛡️ Protection Features

### Branch Protection
- **main**: Production branch (protected)
- **uat**: Customer testing branch (protected)
- **develop**: Team development branch (protected)

### Automatic Checks
- Prevents direct commits to protected branches
- Validates branch naming conventions
- Checks for uncommitted changes before operations
- Warns about potential conflicts

### Git Hooks
The `protect` command installs a pre-push hook that prevents direct pushes to protected branches.

## 🎯 Benefits for Your Team

### Solves Common Problems
1. **"Forgot to pull"** - `start` command automatically pulls latest changes
2. **"Forgot to rebase"** - `sync` command handles rebasing
3. **"Direct commits to main"** - Protection prevents this
4. **"Merge conflicts"** - `conflict` command detects issues early
5. **"Inconsistent naming"** - `validate` command enforces conventions

### Team Workflow Improvements
- **Consistent branch naming** across the team
- **Automated safety checks** before operations
- **Clear workflow guidance** with helpful messages
- **Conflict prevention** through early detection
- **Branch cleanup** to keep repository tidy
